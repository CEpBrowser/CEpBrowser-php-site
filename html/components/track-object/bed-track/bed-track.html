### Build a new track implementation

A new track implementation consists of three components:
*   A track object, handling overall operations and APIs for the track itself.
    This should be a class derived from `GIVe.TrackObject`;
*   __(Optional)__ A track data object, handling all the data operations,
    including the interpretation of responses from the remote side, management
    of local cache and other data-related issues. This should be a class derived
    from `GIVe.TrackDataObject` or `null` if no local data is involved;
*   A track DOM object, handling all inputs from user and graphical output to
    the user interface. This should be a custom Polymer element with
    `GIVe.TrackDOMBehavior` behavior.
It is recommended that each component has its own file (JS file for track object
and track data object, HTML file for DOM object), but smaller files can be
combined (with necessary tags if JS files are to be combined into HTML) if
needed.

This file will serve as an overall `import` file to handle all the dependencies
needed to implement the track. In the example, all the components will be
separated.

### Procedures

First, `import` everything needed to implement a new track.
-->
<link rel="import" href="../track-object.html">

<!--
Then import all other dependencies (omit if none is needed).
-->
<link rel="import" href="../../gene-object/gene-object.html">

<!--
Finally, all the components are either `import`ed (HTML file) or put in
`<script></script>` tags (JS files).
-->
<link rel="import" href="bed-track-dom.html">
<script src="bedTrackData.js"></script>
<script src="bedTrack.js"></script>
