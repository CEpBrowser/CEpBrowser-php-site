Release Notes

* 9/30/2015

	Major UI update. Polymer 1.0 has been used in the query panel.

* 2/19/2015

	Changed the display method so that ENCODE data are no longer log-transformed. This should present a better representation of the actual signal.

	Updated comment function and now you may leave us a comment at https://secure.cepbrowser.org/cpbrowser/feedback.php . 

* 12/13/2014

	Genomic regions can now be used as query. CEpBrowser will find significant orthologous segments within the specified region in the response. Please check the manual for how this works.

	Minor UI and manual update. 

* 1/20/2014

	Minor UI update to improve UI consistency across different browsers and preparation for the next major update.
	Fixed some error in links. 

* 12/16/2013

	Minor UI update to increase the dense view color resolution and to enable track transparency for ENCODE tracks. 

* 12/10/2013

	Added ENCODE data support, ENCODE data now can be accessed via http://encode.cepbrowser.org/
	Major UI update.
		The button to invoke Tracks & Data panel has been moved to top level (in Gene Query panel) so that it is accessble even without displaying any genes.
		Rearranged species selection region.

* 5/10/2013

	Minor UI update to enhance site experience under low screen resolution. However, a higher resolution (1152 x 720 and up) is still highly recommended for better experience.

* 4/15/2013

	Data download has been redesigned so that downloading genome-wide wig files will be much easier. Please check the manual for the updated Tracks & Data panel. Also Data Download & More panel has been renamed to Table Browser to better reflect its new role in data downloading and other functionalities.
	Fixed a bug preventing Navigation panel to update normally when gene name contains ".".

* 1/30/2013

	Data download and beta custom tracks feature has been implemented under Data Download & More section to the right of Visualization panel.

* 8/22/2012

	CEpBrowser has got a new domain: http://www.cepbrowser.org/, users are encouraged to use or bookmark the new domain if not already did so. All functions will be still the same under the new domain (some browser cookies may be resetted due to the domain change, which will be a minor issue).

* 6/13/2012

	Added a new data series (hESC to hNEC differentiation by Joanne Wysocka Lab) to enhance comparison of stem cell results among different species. (Reference: Rada-Iglesias, A., Bajpai, R., Swigut, T., Brugmann, S.A., Flynn, R.A., and Wysocka, J. (2011). A unique chromatin signature uncovers early developmental enhancers in humans. Nature 470, 279-283.)

* 6/9/2012

	Updated gene name system to include more aliases. Now the gene-name auto-completion will also respond to gene aliases, and partial gene name search will return results based on gene aliases. The alias matching the search will be shown in parentheses beside the gene name in both usage.

* 5/29/2012

	Major re-work of the user interface. Implemented track selection panel to allow showing / hiding of specific data tracks across all species.
		Implemented track information & settings panel of the browser. This panel can be called out by clicking the grey button on the left of every track.
		Visualization panel of individual species is now collapsible.
		Manual is updated to reflect the latest revisions.
		Other minor revision on the user interface.

* 4/3/2012

	Major re-work of the user interface.
		Used Ajax to auto-complete gene name as typed, removed the gene list to simplify the input area.
		Removed controls of the genome browser (may be implemented in other ways to enable finer control of the browser).
		Added "Navigation" panel to enable simultaneous and individual navigation / zooming of browsers.

* 11/25/2011

	Updated orthologous gene list to include genes with only two-way orthologs throughout the three species.

* 09/26/2011

	Tracks in "Dense" display mode will have their signal shown in gradient from transparent to opaque black so that they don't block the underlying orthologous shades.
	Minor change to improve performance.

* 02/21/2011

	Minor change in user interface for better compatibility with IE and Firefox.
	Lab Specific Tracks now contains the information about the dataset. (See ./manual.html#trackinfo for more information.)

* 02/15/2011

	Changed name into Comparative EpiGenomic Browser.

* 02/08/2011

	Minor change in user interface.
	Manual page updated to include the available database and reflect the changes in the interface.
	Default track positions have been changed according their content.

* 02/07/2011

	Index page updated, short instructions will be provided on start.
	Manual page added.

* 02/02/2011

	Beta version online.
	New UI implemented.
	Addition of domestic pig (sus scrofa) as the third species.
	Fixed an error which may cause multi-species alignment shade to be outdated if multiple user are using the browser.
