# GIVE Tutorial 2: Deploy GIVE to you local machine

Using GIVE-Hub is the easiest way to build a customized genome browser. For users who want to host their own data source, local deployment of GIVE is a good choice and it's not difficult.  

We provide two approaches for deploying GIVE to local machines or cloud services, which are GIVE-Docker and custom installation.

The traditional way is custom installation. However, it's always annoying to configure the dependencies and environments, especially for users lack of Linux administration experience. So we recommend a modern way, GIVE-Docker based on Docker container virtualization technology. You can use GIVE-Docker to deploy GIVE in minutes without any affects to host system. Furthermore, GIVE deployed with GIVE-Docker has the same performance to that system-level installed.

We documented both approaches of deployment in tutorial 2.1 and 2.2. The following links will lead you to them.
