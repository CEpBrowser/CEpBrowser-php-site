# Easy local deployment of GIVE using GIVE-Docker
The traditional way to deploy web service needs to install dependencies and configure environment at the operating system level. Although we documented a comprehensive manual for system-level installation of GIVE, it's hard for users who lack experience in Linux administration to follow. Even for expert users, it's always annoying to do it. 
Here, we provide a modern approach to deploy GIVE, **GIVE-Docker**. We build GIVE-Docker based on [Docker container technology](https://www.docker.com/what-container). It's an operating-system-level virtualization technology, and it makes build, ship and deploy standardized software and web service much easier and more elegant without performance drop. We recommend all users to use GIVE-Docker for deployment.
