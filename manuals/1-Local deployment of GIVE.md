# Local deployment of GIVE
We provide two approaches for deploying GIVE to local machines or cloud services, which are **system-level installation** and **GIVE-Docker**. 

The traditional way is system-level installation. However, it's always annoying to configure the dependencies and environments, especially for users lack of Linux administration experience. So we recommend a modern way, GIVE-Docker based on Docker container virtualization technology. You can use GIVE-Docker to deploy GIVE in minutes without any affects to host system. Furthermore, GIVE deployed with GIVE-Docker has the same performance to that system-level installed. 

We documented both approaches of deployment. The following links will lead you to a GIVE-Docker usage tutorial and system-level installation manual. __The GIVE-Docker approach is highly recommended.__
