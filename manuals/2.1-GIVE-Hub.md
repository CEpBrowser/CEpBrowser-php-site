# Using GIVE Web Components via GIVE Hub

GIVE Web Components can be used the same way you use other HTML tags, like `<div>` or `<video>`.

GIVE has a dedicated page named GIVE Hub to facilitate selection of track groups and/or tracks and generate HTML codes necessary to embed a customized genome browser with GIVE Web Components.

## Table of Contents

*   [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
*   [Components on the GIVE Hub page](#components-on-the-give-hub-page)
*   [Irons in HTML Generator Mode](#irons-in-html-generator-mode)
*   [GIVE HTML Embed Code Generator](#give-html-embed-code-generator)

## Prerequisites

The GIVE Hub page of the Public GIVE Server is at <https://www.givengine.org/give-hub.html>.

***
*__NOTE:__ If you have deployed your own GIVE instance or want to use any instance other than the Public GIVE Server, you may launch the GIVE Hub page on your desired GIVE instance by substituting the host name with the host name of the instance.*
***

## Components on the GIVE Hub page

GIVE Hub page shows all the supported reference(s) on the instance and tracks within each reference. Please refer to the figure and the table below for all the components on the GIVE Hub page.

![GIVE Hub page](images/2-1-Give-Hub-page.png)

| # | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | The drop-down list to select your reference from references on the GIVE instance. After selection, the list of tracks/groups will refresh automatically. |
| 2 | List of all tracks and track groups in the reference. |
| 3 | Button to toggle HTML Generator Mode. Button will turn dark when the mode is active. |
| 4 | Button to invoke [GIVE HTML Embed Code Generator](#give-html-embed-code-generator). This button is shown when HTML Generator Mode is active and is enabled only when at least one track/group is selected. |
| 5 | Icons indicating the current status of the track group / track. They will only be shown when HTML Generator Mode is active. |

## Irons in HTML Generator Mode

The following icons will appear __before track groups__ when HTML Generator Mode is active.

| Icon | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="images/2-1-icon-block.svg" height="16" width="16"> | This group is not selected and will not be available in the resulting browser. |
| <img src="images/2-1-icon-check-circle.svg" height="16" width="16"> | This group has been selected. Its tracks will be available to be chosen in the resulting browser. However, the tracks of this group are not shown by default unless they have the <img src="images/2-1-icon-visibility.svg" height="16" width="16"> icon (see below). |
| <img src="images/2-1-icon-lock-outline.svg" height="16" width="16"> | One or more tracks from this group has been selected to be shown by default (with a <img src="images/2-1-icon-visibility.svg" height="16" width="16"> icon). The group will not be able to be deselected until all its tracks are deselected. |

The following icons will appear __before individual tracks__ when HTML Generator Mode is active.

| Icon | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="images/2-1-icon-block.svg" height="16" width="16"> | This track is not selected, nor is its group selected. It will not be available in the resulting browser. |
| <img src="images/2-1-icon-check-circle.svg" height="16" width="16"> | The group of this track has been selected. It will be available to be chosen in the resulting browser. However, it will not be shown by default unless it also have the <img src="images/2-1-icon-visibility.svg" height="16" width="16"> icon. |
| <img src="images/2-1-icon-visibility.svg" height="16" width="16"> | This track has been selected to be shown by default. It will be directly shown in the resulting browser. |

## GIVE HTML Embed Code Generator

GIVE HTML Embed Code Generator can be invoked by clicking the "GENERATE" button after selecting one or mode tracks/groups. The description of components of GIVE HTML Embed Code Generator is shown in the figure and the table below.

| # | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Labels showing the reference, groups, and tracks selected in the customized browser. |
| 2 | Select the web component to be embedded. `<chart-controller>` (full genome browser with track control, gene or coordinate input), or `<chart-area>` (chart area of a genome browser only). |
| 3 | *Optional*. If `<chart-controller>` is selected, define the title shown on the title bar of the Chart Controller.  |
| 4 | Select the display mode of the browser. __Single window__ or __Dual window__. |
| 5 | *Optional*. Specify the default coordinates to be shown in the resulting customized browser. You may search for genes by providing (partial) gene name, then selecting the gene in the prompted list. __Note:__ in __Dual window__ mode, if one coordinate is specified, the other one needs to be specified as well. |
